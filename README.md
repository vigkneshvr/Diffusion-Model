***Diffusion Models***\\
Implemented state of the art diffusion model technique for image generation and denoising task. Due to limited availability to compute resources only part of the dataset was used for training. Hence the quality of the generated images may not meet expectations.

**Dataset**
The dataset is the Animal Faces-HQ dataset [AFHQ](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2/blob/master/README.md#animal-faces-hq-dataset-afhq). It consists of 15,000 highquality
images at 512 Ã— 512 resolution. The dataset includes three domains of cat, dog, and wildlife, but I used only cats to reduce computation complexity.
